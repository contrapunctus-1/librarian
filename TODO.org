1. Change ~librarian-form-category~ to ignore anything which is currently classified as ~:misc~, once we handle all definition forms.
* Maybe
1. If Cask file found in directory, use Cask to determine project files to look in (see commit 7cbf510)
2. Add other backends
3. Some way to insert into an existing Org file at a specific point
   * Maybe specify a heading name which will be replaced; Librarian could demote the generated index to be at the same level as the given heading.
* Think
1. Use structure of the source file? Or make headings based on definition type?
