* Certain
1. Change ~librarian-form-category~ to ignore anything which is currently classified as ~:misc~, once we handle all definition forms.
2. Single-file/multi-file output. With a single file, you just have a top-level heading called "Reference". With multiple files, you have a top-level "Reference" heading with sub-headings for each file. (maybe reflecting the directory structure too)
* Maybe
1. If Cask file found in directory, use Cask to determine project files to look in (see commit 7cbf510)
2. Some way to insert into an existing Org file at a specific point
   * Maybe specify a heading name which will be replaced; Librarian could demote the generated index to be at the same level as the given heading.
3. Add other backends
